1. The palindrome finder currenlty ignores case. 
You would need to add code so that any spaces in a string are ignored, 
as well as punctuation marks. the replaceAll and replace methods would help with this.

2. a -> ({[]]})([])
b -> ({[ *balanced is false as next parenthesis is }, thus no more would be added or removed.
c -> (()) *EmptyStackException occurs here; balanced is false.
