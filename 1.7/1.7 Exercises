package pack1;
public class Class1
{
	private int v1;
	protected int v2;
	int v3;
	public int v4;
}

package pack1;
public class Class2{...}

package pack2;
public class Class3 extends pack1.Class1{...}

package pack2;
public class Class4{...}

a. In order for the variables declared in pack1.Class1 to be visible in pack1.Class2, pack1.Class1's variables must not be private.
As long as the variables are not private, they are accessible to other classes in the package.

b. In order for the variables declared in pack1.Class1 to be visible in pack2.Class3, pack1.Class1's variables must be either protected
or public visibility. Private variables are not visible outside of the class they are declared in, and package visible variables are
not visible outside of the package they are declared in (Class 3 is not in the same package). Protected visibility allows visibility
to subclasses, and Class3 is a subclass of Class1.

c. Variables in pack1.Class1 must have public visibility to be visible in pack2.Class4. Only public visibility allows classes
outside of the package to have access to variables in the package (if the Class looking for visibility is not a subclass).

Syntax for package declaration:

package packageName;
