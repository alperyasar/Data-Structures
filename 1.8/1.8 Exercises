Self Check

1. Shape cannot be an actual class because there is no shape that is named a "Shape".
A shape is an abstract idea encompassing multiple different figures (such as rectangles and squares),
but it is not itself a an actual thing, and thus it is an abstract class; an idea.

2. A shape cannot be an interface because it needs both the variable of the shape name and the non-abstract method toString override.
In addition, as an abstract class we are able to give the Shape class a constructor, allowing the actual shapes to call
the super's constructor.
