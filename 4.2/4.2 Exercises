1.  //display all the elements in a queue using just the queue operations
//post: all items are removed
public void printQueue(Queue queue)
{
	while(!queue.isEmpty())
	{
		System.out.println(queue.remove());
	}
}

2. s is a Stack of strings, and q is a Queue of strings.
(a) After the first loop, all the items that were in s are in q. s is empty.
(b) After the second loop, all the items are returned to s in reverse order. q is empty.

String item; // make a new empty string
while(!s.empty()) //while there are still items in the Stack
{
	item = s.pop(); //get the first item from the stack
	q.offer(item); //add it to the end of the queue
}
while(!q.isEmpty()) //while the queue is not empty
{
	item = q.remove(); //get the first item from the queue
	s.push(item); //push it onto the stack
}
