Exercises

1. Thome, Abreu, Jones, Harris (4); Abreu, Jones, Harris (3; Thome is removed)

2. Dustin, Robin, Debbie, Rich, Philip, Harris (6); Robin, Debbie, Rich, Philip, Harris (5; Dustin is removed)

3. 
myQueue.offer("Hello"); //add "Hello" to the queue
myQueue.offer("Bye"); //add "Bye" to the end of the queue
System.out.println(myQueue.peek()); //print out "Hello" on the console; "Hello" is not removed
myQueue.remove(); //remove "Hello" from the queue
myQueue.offer("Welcome"); //add "Welcome to the end of the queue
if(!myQueue.isEmpty()) //if the queue is not empty
{
	System.out.println(myQueue.remove()
		+ ", new size is " + myQueue.size()); //print out "Bye, new size is 1" and remove "Bye" from queue
	System.out.println("Item in front is " + myQueue.peek()); 
	//print out "Item in front is Welcome" without removing Welcome
}

4.
while (!names.isEmpty())
{
	System.out.println(names.remove());
}

This statement will print out all of the items in the queue names in order.

5. Using peek instead of remove will create an infinite loop, 
because the first name in the queue will be printed out endlessly,
not changing the size of names.
