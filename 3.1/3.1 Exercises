1. names.push("Jane");  --> put "Jane" on top of the stack
names.push("Joseph");   --> put "Joseph" on top of the stack
String top = names.pop(); -> create a new string (referenced by top) that holds "Joseph" (Joseph is removed from the stack)
String nextTop = names.peek(); -> create a new string (referenced by nextTop) that holds "Jane" (Jane is not removed from the stack)

2.This code would print out the stack in the order "Philip", "Dustin", ..."Rich" and empty the stack.

3. Changing the code to peek would make it so that the stack would not be emptied.
