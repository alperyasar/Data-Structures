# Data-Structures
A collection of Java code adapted from "Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java" (2nd Edition) by Elliot Koffman and Paul Wolfgang

When I first took the class "Computer Science II" (http://faculty.washington.edu/joelross/courses/archive/s13/cs261/) I failed with a D+ grade. Determined not to fail again, I've been working my way through the textbook of the class (A) so that I know my data structures and (B) so that I can say that I am a master of Java.

However, I don't drink Java coffee, so there's that.
